The 2020 election was a tight race between Republican nominee President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, the election system has changed to accommodate the difficult circumstances with increasing mail-in ballots, early voting, vitual campaigns, etc. This analysis looks into the 2020 Exploratory Testing Survey from American National Election Studies(ANES) between April 10, 2020 and April 18, 2020 with questions regarding changes in the political environment and recent developments in social science research. Exploration Data Analysis is conducted to identify the differences between Trump and Biden voters and their view in key issues issues.

The analysis shows that 43% of the participants voted for Biden while 40.8% voted for Trump. For the participants who voted for Trump in 2016, 87.9% of them kept their choice and voted for Trump in 2020 while 7.8% changed their vote to Biden. The number of people who did not vote in 2016 drop from 21.3% to 7.7% in 2020. Among those who decided to vote in 2020, 33.1% voted for Biden while 27% voted for Trump. Biden has more female voters while Trump has more male voters, Biden has more voters with higher education than Bachelor’s degree while Trump has more voters with lower education. Biden's voters have lower total household income than Trump's voters. Most Biden's voters are Democrat and most Trump's voters are Republican but there is a higher percentage of Democrat voters voted for Trump than Republican voted for Biden. More independent voters voted for Biden than Trump.

The two group of voters have different views on the accuracy of voting by mail with Trump's voters strong disbelieve in the accuracy of voting by mail. They also have extreme views on the way Trump handles his job as president with Biden's voters mostly disapprove strongly while Trump's voters approved strongly. However, there are more Biden's voters who approval Trump's economic policies over other issues. 

All voters are somewhat worried about getting COVID but extremely worried about the upcoming economic impact. Most Trump's voters are not extremely worried about catching COVID-19 while most Biden's voters are more concerned. Trump's voters are against abortion and sugguest that abortion right should be tighten with laws while Biden's voters mostly believe that woman should always have abortion right and some support tightening abortion laws. Trump's voters believes that attention to sexual harassment from the #MeToo movement has gone too far while Biden's voters thinks it's not gone far enough. Overall, most voters thinks it's has been about right.
